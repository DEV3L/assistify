### Description

**Business Value**: By providing users with a comprehensive list of available Assistants assigned to them, we are enhancing the accessibility and usability of our system. This will enable users to quickly identify the support they have at their disposal, thereby significantly improving their workflow and productivity.

**Problem**: Currently, users are facing a significant challenge as they do not have a clear way to view the Assistants assigned to them. This limitation is hindering their ability to fully utilize the potential of AI-powered Assistants.

**Description**: As a development team, we want to implement a page that lists the Assistants assigned to the user by hooking up the AI Dev3loper assistant management libraries and creating an authorized endpoint to fetch and display this information so that users can easily see and access their assigned Assistants.

The tasks involved include:

1. Integrating the AI Dev3loper assistant management libraries into the running application.
2. Creating an authorized backend endpoint that:
   - Reads the Assistants from the system.
   - Maps Assistants to the user based on assignment/authorization.
   - Returns this information from the endpoint.
3. Creating a new page on the frontend that:
   - Fetches the list of Assistants for the authenticated user from the authorized endpoint.
   - Displays the Assistants in a user-friendly manner.
4. Adding an icon to the dashboard that links to the Assistants page and shows the list when clicked.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
_Given_ the integration with AI Dev3loper assistant management libraries
_When_ a user accesses the Assistants page from the dashboard
_Then_ they should see a list of Assistants assigned to them, with each Assistant displayed in a user-friendly manner.
